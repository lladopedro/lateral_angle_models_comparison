# lateral_angle_models_comparison
This repository provides the code to reproduce the figures of the paper (under review) "A comparative study of human auditory models of interaural processing for lateral angle estimation".

To run, it needs the Auditory Modelling Toolbox for most functions (https://amtoolbox.org/) and the PrecSep Toolbox to run Faller2004 model (https://www.iosr.uk/software/index.php#PrecSep).

The scripts to reproduce the figures in the paper are named MC_FIG_XXX.

To run takanen2013, Matlab needs to interface with Python. To enable that, verhulst2012pl must be modified to make it work with the Python environment.
